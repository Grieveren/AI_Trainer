# AI Trainer Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First

Code quality is non-negotiable and MUST be maintained at the highest standard throughout
the project lifecycle.

**Requirements:**
- All code MUST pass linting and static analysis without warnings
- Code MUST follow language-specific style guides and conventions
- Code MUST be self-documenting with clear naming and minimal comments
- Complex logic MUST include explanatory comments
- Dead code and unused imports MUST be removed before commit
- Code reviews MUST verify adherence to quality standards
- Technical debt MUST be documented and tracked

**Rationale:** High code quality reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and enables faster
feature development. Poor quality code compounds over time, creating maintenance burden and
slowing development velocity.

### II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-driven development is MANDATORY for all new features and MUST follow the
red-green-refactor cycle.

**Requirements:**
- Tests MUST be written BEFORE implementation code
- Tests MUST fail initially (red phase)
- Implementation MUST make tests pass (green phase)
- Code MUST be refactored for quality while tests remain green (refactor phase)
- Contract tests MUST be written for all public APIs and interfaces
- Integration tests MUST cover critical user journeys
- Unit tests MUST cover edge cases and error conditions
- Test coverage MUST be measured and maintained above 80% for critical paths
- Tests MUST be independently runnable and not rely on execution order

**Rationale:** TDD ensures features are testable by design, reduces defects, provides
living documentation, and enables confident refactoring. Writing tests first forces clear
thinking about requirements and interfaces before implementation.

### III. User Experience Consistency

User experience MUST be consistent, intuitive, and accessible across all interfaces
and touchpoints.

**Requirements:**
- UI components MUST follow established design patterns and conventions
- Error messages MUST be clear, actionable, and user-friendly
- API responses MUST follow consistent structure and naming conventions
- CLI tools MUST provide helpful usage information and examples
- Loading states and feedback MUST be provided for all async operations
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum) MUST be met for all interfaces
- User flows MUST be tested for intuitive navigation
- Design changes MUST be reviewed for consistency with existing patterns

**Rationale:** Consistent UX reduces cognitive load, improves user satisfaction, and
decreases support burden. Users should not need to relearn patterns across different
parts of the application.

### IV. Performance Requirements

Performance MUST meet defined standards and be continuously monitored and optimized.

**Requirements:**
- API endpoints MUST respond within 200ms for p95 latency
- Page load times MUST be under 2 seconds for initial render
- Database queries MUST be optimized with appropriate indexes
- N+1 query problems MUST be identified and resolved
- Memory usage MUST stay within defined limits for the deployment environment
- Performance metrics MUST be tracked and monitored in production
- Performance regressions MUST be caught in CI/CD pipeline
- Heavy operations MUST be performed asynchronously or in background jobs
- Pagination MUST be implemented for large data sets

**Rationale:** Performance directly impacts user experience and system scalability.
Poor performance leads to user frustration, increased costs, and system instability.
Proactive performance management prevents expensive rewrites.

## Development Standards

### Code Review Process

All code changes MUST go through peer review before merging to main branches.

**Requirements:**
- Pull requests MUST include clear description of changes and rationale
- PRs MUST link to related issues or specifications
- PRs MUST include tests demonstrating the change works
- At least one approval from a project maintainer is REQUIRED
- All CI/CD checks MUST pass before merge
- Code reviewers MUST verify compliance with all constitution principles
- Breaking changes MUST be clearly documented and communicated

### Documentation Requirements

Code and features MUST be adequately documented for maintainability.

**Requirements:**
- Public APIs MUST have clear documentation with examples
- README files MUST be provided at repository and major component levels
- Architecture decisions MUST be documented (ADRs recommended)
- Setup and installation instructions MUST be complete and tested
- Configuration options MUST be documented with sensible defaults
- Troubleshooting guides MUST be provided for common issues

### Version Control Standards

Version control MUST follow established practices for collaboration and traceability.

**Requirements:**
- Commit messages MUST be clear and follow conventional commit format
- Commits MUST be atomic and focused on single logical change
- Feature branches MUST be used for all non-trivial changes
- Main/master branch MUST always be in deployable state
- Merge commits MUST be meaningful and preserve history
- Force pushes to shared branches are PROHIBITED

## Quality Gates

Quality gates are checkpoints that MUST be passed before proceeding to next phase.

### Pre-Development Gates

- [ ] Feature specification reviewed and approved
- [ ] Technical approach documented and reviewed
- [ ] Dependencies and risks identified
- [ ] Test strategy defined
- [ ] Constitution compliance verified

### Pre-Merge Gates

- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, contract)
- [ ] Code review approved by at least one maintainer
- [ ] Linting and static analysis passing without warnings
- [ ] Test coverage meets minimum threshold (80% for critical paths)
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect changes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (if applicable)
- [ ] Security scan completed without high/critical findings

### Pre-Deployment Gates

- [ ] All pre-merge gates passed
- [ ] Integration tests passing in staging environment
- [ ] Performance testing completed and meets SLAs
- [ ] Security review completed for sensitive changes
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Deployment runbook reviewed

## Governance

This constitution establishes the foundational principles and standards for the
AI Trainer project. All development practices, code reviews, and architectural
decisions MUST align with these principles.

### Amendment Process

1. Proposed amendments MUST be documented with clear rationale
2. Amendments MUST be reviewed and approved by project maintainers
3. Breaking changes require migration plan and timeline
4. Version MUST be incremented following semantic versioning:
   - MAJOR: Backward incompatible principle removals or redefinitions
   - MINOR: New principles or materially expanded guidance
   - PATCH: Clarifications, wording fixes, non-semantic refinements
5. All dependent templates and documentation MUST be updated

### Compliance

- All pull requests MUST verify compliance with constitution principles
- Code reviews MUST explicitly check for violations
- Complexity additions MUST be justified in implementation plans
- Constitution violations found in production MUST be tracked and remediated
- Regular audits SHOULD be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance

### Living Document

This constitution is a living document that evolves with the project. Feedback
and improvement suggestions are encouraged. When principles conflict with
practical needs, the constitution SHOULD be amended rather than ignored.
