# Feature Specification: Intelligent Training Optimizer

**Feature Branch**: `001-training-optimizer`
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an intelligent fitness training optimization system that:
- **Automatically fetches** Garmin health and training data
- **Analyzes patterns** using Claude AI to understand your body's signals
- **Generates daily workout recommendations** based on recovery status
- **Creates adaptive training plans** aligned with your goals
- **Prevents overtraining and injury** through smart load management
- **Provides actionable insights** through AI-powered analysis"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Daily Recovery Check and Workout Recommendation (Priority: P1)

As an athlete, I want to check my recovery status each morning and receive a personalized workout recommendation so that I can train effectively without risking overtraining or injury.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - helping users make informed daily training decisions based on their body's readiness. Without this, the system provides no immediate value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by connecting a Garmin account, viewing current recovery metrics (HRV, resting heart rate, sleep quality, stress), and receiving a workout recommendation (type, duration, intensity). Delivers immediate value by preventing poor training decisions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has synced Garmin data overnight, **When** user opens the app in the morning, **Then** system displays current recovery score with color-coded status (green/yellow/red) and explains what metrics influenced the score
2. **Given** user has high recovery score (green), **When** viewing daily recommendation, **Then** system suggests intense or high-volume workout with specific intensity zones and duration
3. **Given** user has low recovery score (red), **When** viewing daily recommendation, **Then** system suggests recovery day or light activity with rationale explaining which metrics indicate need for rest
4. **Given** user has moderate recovery score (yellow), **When** viewing daily recommendation, **Then** system suggests moderate workout with adjusted intensity targets
5. **Given** Garmin data fetch fails, **When** user opens app, **Then** system displays last known status with timestamp and clear message that recommendations may be outdated

### User Story 2 - AI-Powered Training Insights (Priority: P2)

As an athlete, I want to understand patterns in my training and recovery so that I can make better long-term decisions about my training approach.

**Why this priority**: Provides deeper value beyond daily recommendations by helping users understand their body's responses and trends. Builds on P1 by adding learning and pattern recognition.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by viewing historical data analysis showing trends, correlations, and insights. User can learn from patterns without needing the daily recommendations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has 2+ weeks of training data, **When** user views insights, **Then** system displays AI-generated analysis of training patterns including optimal training days, recovery trends, and stress-performance correlations
2. **Given** user has consistent training for 4+ weeks, **When** viewing insights, **Then** system identifies personal patterns such as "You recover best with 48 hours between hard sessions" or "Your HRV drops most after evening workouts"
3. **Given** user shows signs of accumulated fatigue, **When** viewing insights, **Then** system proactively warns about overtraining risk with specific metrics supporting the warning
4. **Given** user has varied workout types, **When** viewing insights, **Then** system shows which workout types yield best adaptations and which cause most fatigue
5. **Given** insufficient data exists, **When** user views insights, **Then** system clearly states how many more days of data are needed and what patterns it's beginning to detect

### User Story 3 - Adaptive Training Plan Creation (Priority: P3)

As an athlete with a specific goal, I want to create a multi-week training plan that adapts based on my actual recovery and progress so that I can systematically work toward my goal while staying healthy.

**Why this priority**: Extends the system from reactive (daily decisions) to proactive (structured planning). Builds on P1 and P2 by using insights to create forward-looking plans.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by defining a goal (e.g., "5K in under 25 minutes in 12 weeks"), generating a training plan, and seeing how the plan adjusts week-to-week based on actual recovery data. Delivers value as a complete training program.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user defines a goal with target date, **When** creating training plan, **Then** system generates week-by-week plan with daily workouts, rest days, and progression that aligns with goal timeline
2. **Given** user is following a training plan, **When** recovery score is consistently low, **Then** system automatically adjusts upcoming week's plan by reducing volume or intensity
3. **Given** user is progressing faster than expected, **When** system reviews weekly progress, **Then** plan adapts by safely increasing training load or advancing timeline
4. **Given** user misses planned workouts, **When** viewing plan, **Then** system reorganizes remaining weeks to maintain goal feasibility or suggests adjusted goal if timeline is no longer realistic
5. **Given** user completes key milestone workouts, **When** plan updates, **Then** system recalibrates future training based on demonstrated fitness level
6. **Given** user wants to review plan before starting, **When** viewing generated plan, **Then** system shows rationale for periodization approach and explains how intensity will progress

### User Story 4 - Manual Data Integration and Goal Tracking (Priority: P4)

As an athlete, I want to manually log workouts done outside Garmin devices and track progress toward my goals so that I have a complete training picture even when not using my Garmin device.

**Why this priority**: Handles edge cases and increases system flexibility. Not critical for core value but improves completeness.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by manually entering a workout, viewing it in training history, and seeing it factored into recovery calculations and goal progress.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user completes workout without Garmin device, **When** manually logging workout, **Then** system accepts workout type, duration, perceived exertion, and factors it into load calculations
2. **Given** user is tracking toward a goal, **When** viewing progress, **Then** system displays visual progress indicator with key milestones and estimated completion date
3. **Given** user has multiple active goals, **When** viewing dashboard, **Then** system shows progress on each goal with clear indication of which is on track and which may need attention

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user's Garmin account connection expires or is revoked?
- How does system handle gaps in data (e.g., user forgot to wear device for several days)?
- What happens when user manually enters workout data that conflicts with Garmin data for the same time?
- How does system adjust recommendations when user is sick or injured (not just fatigued)?
- What happens when user's goals are unrealistic given their current fitness level?
- How does system handle unusual data (e.g., extremely high resting HR indicating illness)?
- What happens when Claude AI service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does system respond when user consistently ignores recommendations (e.g., trains hard despite red recovery status)?

## Assumptions

1. **Garmin Data Access**: We assume Garmin's API provides necessary health metrics (HRV, resting HR, sleep, stress) and workout data with sufficient detail for analysis. If specific metrics are unavailable, we'll use alternative indicators.

2. **User Device Usage**: We assume users wear their Garmin devices consistently (5+ days per week) to provide sufficient data for meaningful analysis.

3. **Claude AI Availability**: We assume Claude AI API is available with acceptable response times for generating insights. System should gracefully degrade if AI is temporarily unavailable by showing cached insights.

4. **Recovery Score Algorithm**: We'll use industry-standard formulas for recovery scoring that weight HRV (40%), resting HR (30%), sleep (20%), and stress (10%) as baseline, then refine based on user feedback.

5. **Training Load Calculation**: We assume Garmin provides training load metrics or we can calculate equivalent using heart rate zone duration and workout type.

6. **User Fitness Level**: System will establish baseline fitness through initial data collection period (minimum 7-14 days) before providing fully personalized recommendations.

7. **Goal Setting**: We assume users can define realistic goals with support from goal-setting guidance. System will validate goal feasibility based on current fitness and timeline.

8. **Internet Connectivity**: System requires internet connection for Garmin data sync and AI analysis but should provide cached data and recommendations when offline.
