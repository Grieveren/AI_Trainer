# Specification Quality Checklist: Intelligent Training Optimizer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality Assessment:**
- ✅ Specification avoids technical implementation details (no mention of specific frameworks, languages, or databases)
- ✅ Focus is on user value: daily training decisions, injury prevention, goal achievement
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders (explains metrics in plain language)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

**Requirement Completeness Assessment:**
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements have reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions
- ✅ Requirements are testable (e.g., "System MUST calculate daily recovery score (0-100 scale)")
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "within 30 seconds", "85% of users", "40% fewer incidents")
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on user outcomes, not system internals)
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format with specific conditions and outcomes
- ✅ Edge cases identified comprehensively (8 scenarios covering data gaps, conflicts, errors)
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded with explicit "Out of Scope" section
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions documented (8 assumptions listed)

**Feature Readiness Assessment:**
- ✅ Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-036) maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- ✅ User scenarios cover all primary flows: P1 (daily recommendations), P2 (insights), P3 (plans), P4 (manual logging)
- ✅ Success criteria span user value, performance, data quality, injury prevention, and engagement
- ✅ No implementation leakage - specification remains at "what" and "why" level

## Overall Status

**✅ SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` to begin technical design.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Run `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan with technical architecture
2. Consider running `/speckit.clarify` if stakeholders want to review edge case handling in more detail
3. Review constitution compliance during planning phase
