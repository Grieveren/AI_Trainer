"""
Unit tests for Resting Heart Rate component of recovery score.

HR Component Algorithm:
- Calculate 7-day rolling average resting HR
- Compare today's HR to average (INVERSE relationship - lower is better):
  - -5% or more below average = 100 (excellent recovery)
  - At average (0% deviation) = 50 (normal)
  - +5% above average = 25
  - +10% or more above average = 0 (poor recovery)
- Linear interpolation between points
